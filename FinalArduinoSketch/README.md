This is the code that allows my arduino robot to follow black lines using its QTI sensors, as well as detect objects using an IR receiver and sensor

*I just opened this code for the first time in about a year and I am now realizing how terrible it is. I could have used a lot more functions and variables. This was a younger, more ignorant Jesse.
